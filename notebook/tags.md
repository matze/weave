# Special tags

Zk tags are used to group notes of a related topic however there are three tags
that have a special meaning for weave. To quickly share notes and ideas, you can
tag a note `#public` which makes it accessible even when not being signed in. To
reduce clutter, tag a note with `#archived` to push it to the bottom of the note
list and render it grayed out. To move a note to the top of the note list, tag
it with `#pin`.
